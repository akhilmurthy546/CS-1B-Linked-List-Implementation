FEEDBACK:

Accepted as on time.


Good implementation of class CountryList getIndex() method. Consider adding
   exception handling in case of invalid index request.
   

-0 Using the method call getIndicatorForYear() is decreases your application performance:
      
    public String toString()
    {
        String output = getName();
        for(int i = 0; i < indicators.length; i++)
        {
            output += " " + getIndicatorForYear(indicators[i].getYear());
        }
    Consider instead relying on the toString() method of the overridden Indicators class:
    For example:
    
    public String toString()
    {
        String output = getName();
        for(int i = 0; i < indicators.length; i++)
        {
            output += " " + indicators[i];  // Note: Recall the String type is immutable

    Better yet instead of String concatenation which is also computationally expensive
    use a more flexible class such as StringBuilder.


Good test cases which update your linked list.
    
-Bita.
